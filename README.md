# pytorch-mask-rcnn-samples

Example notebooks and updated project files from the PyTorch MaskRCNN port:  https://github.com/multimodallearning/pytorch-mask-rcnn

Then see `Setup_and_Demo.py` for setup and `Train_Fish.ipynb` for the Dataset configuration, training and evaluation code.

See the original repo for more information.

Note:  Running this example will need data in a folder called `fish_pics` for and a `logs` folder to contain model files.  Note that at each epoch a trained model is produced unless code is modified otherwise.

> TIP:  You can run this project inside a Docker image such as the `rheartpython/cvdeep` public image that has many Deep Learning frameworks preinstalled.  (more info at https://github.com/michhar/custom-jupyterhub-linux-vm)
